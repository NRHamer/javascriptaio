# Chapter 3 - JavaScript Multiple Values

Objects and arrays can contain multiple values.

You can look at objects as a collection of properties and methods.

Properties can be thought of as variables. They can be simple data structures such as numbers and strings, but also other objects.

Methods perform actions; they contain a certain number of lines of code that will be executed when the method gets called. Methods will be explained in greater detail in later chapters.

An example of an object can be a real-life object, for example, a dog. It has properties, such as name, weight, colour, and breed.

We wil also discuss arrays. An array is a type of object, which allows you to store multiple values. Arrays can take the form of a single variable, holding multiple values.

In this chapter we will cover the following topics:

# Arrays and their properties

Arrays are lists of values.

These values can be of all data types and one array can even contain different data types.

It is often very useful to store multiple values inside one variable; for example, a list of groceries, or test scores. They can be used to keep track of all the user input, or when you want to have a list of options to present to the user.

## Creating arrays

The way to create arrays is as follows:

```
arr1 = ["black", "orange", "pink"];
```

A second method to create arrays works as follows. If you wanted to create an array with 10 undefined values you would use:

```
arr2 = new Array(10);
```
